INTERACTIVE FLAT PANEL An interactive LED is a device that lets you control your PC or MAC with your fingers or a stylus on a large touch screen. You can run any application from your computer and use our software to draw, write, share and cast your screen to other devices. You can also use the built-in Android system to access hundreds of apps from the TouchIT App Store and install them on the LED. The LED has 10-point multi-touch capability, which means you can use up to 10 fingers or styluses at the same time. It also comes with a 3-year on-site warranty (USA & Canada) and a long lifespan of 50 000 hours.
