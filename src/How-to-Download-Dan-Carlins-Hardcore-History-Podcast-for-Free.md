If you want to listen to the entire catalog of Hardcore History episodes without paying anything, you have a few options. One of them is to use torrent sites, which are platforms that allow users to share files over a peer-to-peer network. Torrent sites can be risky, as they may contain malware, viruses, or illegal content. You also need a torrent client, such as BitTorrent or uTorrent, to download the files.
 
One of the torrent sites that has a complete collection of Hardcore History episodes is SolidTorrents[^1^]. You can find it by searching for "Dan Carlin Hardcore History Torrent" on any web browser. Once you are on the site, you can see the list of files and their sizes. You can also see the number of seeders and leechers, which indicate how fast and reliable the download will be. The more seeders, the better.
 
To download the torrent, you need to click on either the "Torrent Download" or "Magnet Download" button. The former will download a small file that contains information about the torrent, while the latter will open your torrent client directly and start the download. You may need to allow your torrent client to access the file or link. Once the download starts, you can see the progress and speed on your torrent client.
 
Another option is to use Google Drive[^2^], which is a cloud storage service that allows users to upload and share files online. Some fans of Hardcore History have uploaded all the episodes to Google Drive folders and shared them publicly. You can find them by searching for "Hardcore History Omnibus Google Drive" on any web browser. Once you are on the Google Drive page, you can see the list of files and their names.
 
To download the files from Google Drive, you need to select the ones you want and click on the "Download" button at the top right corner. You may need to sign in with your Google account to access the files. You may also see a warning message that says "Google Drive can't scan this file for viruses". This is because some of the files are too large for Google Drive to scan. You can ignore this message and click on "Download anyway". The download will start automatically and you can see the progress and speed on your browser.
 
Both torrent sites and Google Drive are unofficial sources of Hardcore History episodes and may not be authorized by Dan Carlin or his team. They may also be taken down or removed at any time due to legal or ethical reasons. Therefore, if you enjoy listening to Hardcore History and want to support Dan Carlin's work, you may consider buying some of his archived episodes from his website[^3^] or donating to his Patreon[^4^]. This way, you can help him continue producing high-quality and engaging history podcasts for years to come.
